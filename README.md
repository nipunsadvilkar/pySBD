pySBD - python Sentence Boundary Disambiguation (SBD) - is a rule-based sentence boundary detection module that works out-of-the-box.

This project is a direct port of ruby gem - [Pragmatic Segmenter](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_segmenter) which provides rule-based sentence boundary detection.

## Install

**Python**

    pip install pysbd

## Usage

-   Currently pySBD supports only English language. Support for more languages will be released soon.

```python
import pysbd
text = "My name is Jonas E. Smith. Please turn to p. 55."
seg = pysbd.Segmenter(language="en", clean=False)
print(seg.segment(text))
# ['My name is Jonas E. Smith.', 'Please turn to p.Â 55.']
```

-   Use `pysbd` as a [spaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/processing-pipelines) pipeline component. (recommended)</br>Please refer to example [pysbd\_as\_spacy\_component.py](https://github.com/nipunsadvilkar/pySBD/blob/master/examples/pysbd_as_spacy_component.py)
- Use pysbd through [entrypoints](https://spacy.io/usage/saving-loading#entry-points-components)

```python
import spacy
from pysbd.utils import PySBDFactory

nlp = spacy.blank('en')

# explicitly adding component to pipeline
# (recommended - makes it more readable to tell what's going on)
nlp.add_pipe(PySBDFactory(nlp))

# or you can use it implicitly with keyword
# pysbd = nlp.create_pipe('pysbd')
# nlp.add_pipe(pysbd)

doc = nlp('My name is Jonas E. Smith. Please turn to p. 55.')
print(list(doc.sents))
# [My name is Jonas E. Smith., Please turn to p. 55.]

```
